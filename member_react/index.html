  <h1>Welcome to Member_React</h1>
  <p>
    This app is intended for people who are forgetful like me. I hope you use it to organize your life and have fun doing it. I also love traveling with my wife and find a travel board gets me pumped for our next adventures. I hope you find this as useful as I do.

    This is the initial stage of the application and will be developed further from here.
